Require adds the module to the cache so if ever require is called to the same module it can check the cache if its there, this saves it reloading the
whole module again. If a require call is made during the running of the program the current interface will be returned. 

If the module replace its default exports object during a cycle then any module receiving an interface from that module will get the default rather than
the overwritten value.
