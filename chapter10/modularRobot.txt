You'd need a road module to store the raw road array. roads and roadGraph would be in this module.

Then I'd have a graph module that builds the map so only needs buildGraph. This module would require the road module

Then there needs to be a module that holds all the parcel locations so requires VillageState. This module would require and graph module

Then there needs to be a routing module that contains all the possible types the robot can route, so goalOrientedRobot, findRoute, routeRobot, mailRoute,
randomRobot, randomPick and runRobot. 


You could use NPM to improve and reduce the code used. Could use djikstrajs which is a routing algorithm instead of whats in the findRoute, this could also
be put in its own module. This would shrink the code size and make sure that we havent made any errors as this package is used by many other people already
