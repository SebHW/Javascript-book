Use a canvas element as a source image. Create an extra <canvas> element, without adding it to the document
, and draw inverted images to it, once. When drawing an actual frame, just copy the already inverted sprites to the main canvas.

As images do not load instantly a load handler is needed. Once loaded the images are drawn once and can be pulled
from immediately.
